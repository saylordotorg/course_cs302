Course Syllabus for "CS302: Software Engineering"
-------------------------------------------------

Software engineering is a discipline that allows us to apply engineering
and computer science concepts in the development and maintenance of
reliable, usable, and dependable software. The concept of software
engineering was first discussed at the 1968 NATO Science Committee in
Germany. Today, many practitioners still debate over the term *software
engineering*, often arguing that this discipline does not meet the
criteria of engineering; rather, it should be called software
development. There are several areas to focus on within software
engineering, such as design, development, testing, maintenance, and
management. Software development outside of the classroom is a very
complex process, mostly because real-world software is much larger and
more complex. The purpose of this course is to present software
engineering as a body of knowledge. The course is designed to present
software engineering concepts and principles in parallel with the
software development life cycle. The course will begin with an
introduction to software engineering, giving you a definition of this
body of knowledge, as well as a discussion of the main methodologies of
software engineering. You will then learn about the Software Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) followed by software modeling using Unified Modeling
Language (UML), a standardized general-purpose modeling language used to
create visual models of object-oriented software. You will go on to
learn about five major phases of the SDLC: requirements gathering,
requirements analysis, design, coding/implementation, and testing. You
will also learn about project management for the purpose of delivering
high-quality software that satisfies customer needs and is within
budget. By the time the course is complete, you will master software
engineering concepts, principles, and essential processes of the SDLC;
you will demonstrate this knowledge by creating UML artifacts for
requirements gathering, analysis as well as design phases using an
object-oriented methodology.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   demonstrate mastery of software engineering knowledge and skills,
    and professional issues necessary to practice software engineering;
-   discuss principles of software engineering;
-   describe software development life cycle models;
-   apply principles of software modeling through UML as a modeling
    language;
-   identify major activities and key deliverables in a software
    development life cycle during software requirements and analysis,
    software design, and software testing;
-   apply the object-oriented methodology in software engineering to
    create UML artifacts for software analysis and requirements,
    software design, and software testing;
-   apply project management concepts in a software engineering
    environment to manage projects, people, and products; and
-   participate as an individual to deliver quality software systems.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS302: Software Engineering. General information on the
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Irene Wong-Bushby  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  
    
 The Global Text Project: Sue Conger’s *[The New Software
Engineering](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31779972/The%20New%20Software%20Engineering.pdf) *(PDF)  
    
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit will lay the groundwork
for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
later units.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assigned materials in each unit.  
    
 In order to *pass *this course, you will need to earn a score of 70% or
higher on the final exam.Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you about
**135 hours**. Each unit includes a *time advisory *that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, completing Unit 1 should take you approximately
20.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1.1 (a total of 1.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit
1.1.1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.1.1.2 (a total
of 2.5 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.
