**Unit 8: Software Testing** <span id="8"></span> 
*Testing is the process of finding errors and is one of the last
activities in the software life cycle. In testing, we look to validate
that software requirements analysis, software design, and software
implementation mesh together correctly to deliver a software system that
performs as expected, functionally and non-functionally.*  
    
 *As you review this unit, note the three levels of test plan: unit,
integration, and system. Each of these levels of test plan assures the
quality of the overall software from varying levels of granularity. In
your own practice as a software engineer, be sure to incorporate these
levels of testing as this is the last stop before the software goes out
the door representing your professional work and code of ethics.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 8.5 hours.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   define basic software testing terminologies;
-   list and discuss the context of use of various testing strategies,
    including black-box, white-box, top-down, and bottom-up; and
-   design a test plan to include unit, integration, and system levels
    of test coverage.

**8.1 Software Testing Terminologies** <span id="8.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Global Text Project: Sue Conger’s *The New Software
    Engineering*: “Chapter 17: Testing and Quality Assurance”**
    Link: The Global Text Project: Sue Conger’s [*The New Software
    Engineering*](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31779972/The%20New%20Software%20Engineering.pdf): *“*Chapter
    17: Testing and Quality Assurance” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the section titled “Testing Terminology” in
    Chapter 17 (pages 690-694). In this unit, you have a quick
    introduction to many terminologies used in the science (and art) of
    testing. Do not be concerned if you do not understand them fully. We
    will go back and examine these topics in more depth; subunit 8.2
    will look more closely at test strategies (i.e., white-box,
    black-box, top-down, and bottom-up), and subunit 8.3 will examine
    more closely levels of testing (i.e., unit test, integration test,
    and system test). Take notes as you read.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    notes should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read the section titled “Testing Strategies” in
    Chapter 17 (pages 694-706). In this subunit, you will learn about
    two kinds of testing strategies: how the logic is tested (i.e.,
    black-box and white-box testing) and how the testing is conducted
    (i.e., top-down and bottom-up testing). Take your time in reading
    and jot down any ideas or notes that stand out to you as
    particularly useful (or, conversely, confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    should take approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Read the section titled “Test Plan for ABC Video
    Order Processing” in Chapter 17 (pages 706-732). In this subunit,
    see how ABC Video designs testing to validate that specification,
    design, and coding mesh with functional and non-functional
    requirements of the system.  
        
     Take your time in reading and jot down any ideas or notes that
    stand out to you as particularly useful (or, conversely,
    confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
