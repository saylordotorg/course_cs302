**Unit 4: Software Requirements Gathering** <span id="4"></span> 
*Requirements gathering requires the software engineer (in this case, a
business analyst) to interact with the stakeholders, including customer
and users,to gather/collect information about what the software system
being developed needs to do. There is also the situation where vendors
are subcontracted to develop all, or some components, of the software
systems and/or develop the hardware that the software will run on. In
this case, the vendors bid on the subcontract by providing a proposal in
responds to a request for proposals. In this unit, you will learn the
data/information types, data collection techniques, and data collection
and application types. This unit will set the stage for the next two
units:* Unit 5: Software Requirements Analysis*, and* Unit 6: Software
Design*.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 6.5 hours.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   define data types;
-   describe data/requirements gathering techniques;
-   describe data gathering techniques most appropriate for each
    application type; and
-   define *request for proposal* and *evaluation of proposal* regarding
    hardware and software.

    Development”**

    “Chapter 4: Data Gathering for Application Development” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read “Chapter 4: Data Collection/Gathering for
    Application Development” (pages 83-87) about data types.  
        
     There are different data dimensions, including time and volume.
    Each dimension is important in defining requirements of applications
    because it gives guidance to the software engineer about how much
    and what type of information should be collected. Take your time in
    reading and jot down any ideas or notes that stand out to you as
    particularly useful (or, conversely, confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read “Chapter 4: Data Gathering for Application
    Development” (pages 87–98). Data collection/gathering is also
    referred to as *requirements gathering*. Data gathering is the
    interaction between the software engineer (in this case a business
    analyst) and the customers (including users) to obtain/gather
    data/information about the application to be developed. There are
    many techniques for gathering data. The data collection techniques
    include interviews, meetings, observations, questionnaires,
    reviewing software, reviewing internal document, and reviewing
    external documents.Take your time in reading and jot down any ideas
    or notes that stand out to you as particularly useful (or,
    conversely, confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection and taking notes should take approximately 3
