**Unit 7: Implementation** <span id="7"></span> 
*Implementation, also known as programming or coding, is the process of
using a programming language to convert specified requirements into
software source code and later into compiled code for execution.
Programmers can use automated tools to convert design requirements into
code.*  
    
 *Sometimes, vendors are subcontracted to develop all or part of the
software—and even the hardware that it will run on—according to
specified requirements. In these situations, vendors will bid on the
subcontract by providing a proposal.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 8 hours.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   define programming;
-   list and discuss characteristics and selection of
    programming/implementation languages; and
-   discuss the concepts for purchasing of hardware and software.

**7.1 History of Programming** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: ETH Zurich’s Department of Computer Science: Professor
    Emeritus Niklaus Wirth’s “A Brief History of Software Engineering”**
    Link: ETH Zurich’s Department of Computer Science: Professor
    Emeritus Niklaus Wirth’s [“A Brief History of Software
    Engineering”](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Articles/Miscellaneous/IEEE-Annals.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the PDF (10 pages). Pay particular attention to
    programming and the programming languages, and review any notes you
    took in subunit 1.1.1.1.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    should take approximately 1 hour.

**7.2 Choosing Implementation Languages** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Global Text Project: Sue Conger’s The New Software
    Engineering: “Chapter 15: Choosing an Implementation Language”**
    Link: The Global Text Project: Sue Conger’s [*The New Software
    Engineering*](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31779972/The%20New%20Software%20Engineering.pdf):
    “Chapter 15: Choosing an Implementation Language” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read “Chapter 15: Choosing an Implementation
    Language” (pages 640-665). In this reading, you will learn about the
    different programming languages used to convert design
    specifications into software code. Please focus on the languages’
    characteristics and how you would know which language to choose for
    particular projects. Take your time in reading and jot down any
    ideas or notes that stand out to you as particularly useful (or,
    conversely, confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    should take approximately 3 hours.
