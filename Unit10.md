**Unit 10: Putting It Together: A Case Study** <span id="10"></span> 
*This unit pulls together the object-oriented methodology in software
requirements analysis (i.e. Unit 5) and software design (i.e. Unit 6).
You will apply UML to demonstrate your understanding of the software
development life cycle given a set of user requirements. You will also
have the opportunity to apply software testing to assess the quality of
your work.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 6.5 hours.

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   demonstrate the principles of software modeling through the use of
    UML;
-   demonstrate an understanding of software requirements analysis using
    the object-oriented methodology by creating OO analysis artifacts
    for the case study;
-   demonstrate an understanding of software design using
    object-oriented methodology by creating OO design artifacts for the
    case study; and
-   demonstrate an understanding of the three levels of software testing
    by creating a comprehensive test plan for the case study.

**10.1 Preparation** <span id="10.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Sheldon, Jerath, Kwon, and Baik’s “Case Study:
    Implementing a Web Based Auction System Using UML and
    Component-Based Programming”**
    Link: Sheldon, Jerath, Kwon, and Baik’s [“Case Study: Implementing a
    Web Based Auction System Using UML and Component-Based
    Programming”](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.103.3776) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read and evaluate this case study for creating a web
    auction site. Note each UML diagram and its purpose. Imagine that
    you are a software engineer, and the project manager that will
    oversee the implementation of the auction site. What changes will be
    necessary to test and implement the system on the most current
    software and hardware available to you? Take your time in reading
    and jot down any ideas or notes that stand out to you as
    particularly useful (or, conversely, confusing). Please also note
    that there will be questions on the Final Exam in regard to this
    case study.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    should take approximately 2 hours.
