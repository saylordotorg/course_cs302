**Unit 9: Project Management** <span id="9"></span> 
*Project management in a software engineering environment is unique
because of the technical aspects of a software project. The project
manager’s role is different from that of the software engineer’s. While
software engineers are generally accountable for the technical aspects
of a project, the project manager is accountable for organizational
aspects.*  
    
 *As you review the materials of the unit, try to connect this unit with
what you have already learned about the software development life cycle.
You will see that the success of an SDLC depends on people, process and
product. Project management is the glue that holds these aspects
together.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 8.5 hours.

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   explain the role of the project manager relative to the software
    engineer;
-   identify the three areas of responsibilities of a project manager;
-   discuss the concepts of project management in terms of the project
    (i.e., planning, scheduling, execution, etc.);
-   discuss the concepts of project management in terms of the people
    (i.e., hiring, motivating, evaluating, firing, etc.); and
-   discuss the concepts of project management in terms of change
    management (i.e., application, software, configuration, etc.).

     Instructions: Read “Chapter 3: Project Management” (pages 57-82).
    As discussed, the software engineer and the project manager provide
    complementary skills and work collaboratively on shared activities.
    The three main activities of the project manager are organizational
    liaison, personnel management, and project monitoring and
    control. The section titled “Liaison” (pages 67-70) discusses the
    project manager’s role as a go-between for the technical team and
    agents who are not members of the technical team (e.g. project
    sponsor, user, IS management, vendors, etc.) In the section titled
    “Personnel Management,” (pages 70-74) you will learn that this job
    entails working with personnel (i.e., human resources) to hire,
    fire, and provide employees with professional development. The
    section titled “Monitor and Control” (pages 74-79) explains that
    project monitoring involves tracking project progress relative to
    budget. Project control means implementing changes when progress is
    not satisfactory (e.g. training, revising project plans, etc.). Take
    your time in reading and jot down any ideas or notes that stand out
    to you as particularly useful (or, conversely, confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend
    should take approximately 4 hours.

**9.2 Change Management** <span id="9.2"></span>

     Instructions: Read “Chapter 18: Change Management” (pages 735-764).
    A critical component of project monitoring and control is change
    management. As business requirements and operating environments
    change all the time, the project manager has to manage change
    throughout the software development cycle from acquisition, supply,
    development, operation to maintenance. The guiding principles,
    techniques, and tools for change management are discussed in this
    chapter. Take your time in reading and jot down any ideas or notes
    that stand out to you as particularly useful (or, conversely,
    confusing).  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and taking time to comprehend

**9.2.1 Designing for Maintenance** <span id="9.2.1"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered in the reading under subunit 9.2. Please
focus on the section titled “Designing for Maintenance” on pages 735-741
of the reading. Applications that are designed with change in mind
(i.e., flexibility) are easier and less costly to maintain.

**9.2.2 Application Change Management** <span id="9.2.2"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered in the reading under subunit 9.2. Please
focus on the section titled “Application Change Management” on pages
741-749 of the reading. Applications frequently change because of
changing business or technical environments. By establishing application
change management procedures, the changes may be tracked, reviewed, and
prioritized.

**9.2.3 Software Management** <span id="9.2.3"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered in the reading under subunit 9.2. Please
focus on the section titled “Software Management” on pages 749-751 of
the reading. A core concept in software management is to decide whether
to maintain or to retire the application. When an application no longer
works or when maintenance cost is high, the application becomes a
potential candidate for retiring.

**9.2.4 Configuration Management** <span id="9.2.4"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered in the reading under subunit 9.2. Please
focus on the section titled “Configuration Management” on pages 751-756
of the reading. Configuration management is the identification,
organization, and control of software changes. Software changes are
developed over a fixed version of working code (*baseline* code). This
is released and becomes the new baseline for the next set of software
changes.

**9.2.5 Automated Tools** <span id="9.2.5"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered in the reading under subunit 9.2. Please
focus on the section titled “Automated Tools for Change Management” on
pages 756-759 of the reading. A variety of automated tools exist that
can facilitate and increase productivity for change management. These
include collaborative work tools, documentation tools, reverse
engineering tools, and configuration management tools.
