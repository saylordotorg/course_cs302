**Unit 3: Software Modeling** <span id="3"></span> 
*Many believe that good design is fundamental to creating successful
software. The first step in software creation is to* *gather
requirements.Notations, such as UML, allow us to articulate complex
ideas succinctly and precisely. Designing software requires the use of
certain industry standard design tools, and mastery of them is essential
to becoming a capable software engineer.*  
    
 *This unit will introduce you to UML, a standardized general-purpose
modeling language for creating visual models of object-oriented
software. This unit aims to give you a comprehensive understanding of
UML, the five fundamental artifacts of UML, and modeling concepts, as
well as the modeling concepts’ relationships to the terms* system*,*
model*, and* view*.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 16.25 hours.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   list and identify the context appropriate for five commonly used UML
    artifacts; and
-   apply abstraction to the UML artifacts to arrive at essential
    object-oriented modeling concepts.
