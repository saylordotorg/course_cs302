**Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering** <span id="1"></span> 
*When dependency on software and computers became more important,
software grew in size and became a necessity for businesses and users
all over the world. In the last 30 years, we have seen an unparalleled
explosion in the amount of software produced and used by our modern
society. There is nowa need to set concrete objectives (e.g. functional
requirements), predict necessary resources (e.g. cost estimates) to
attain those objectives, and manage customers’ expectations.*  
    
 *As you review the material in this unit, compare and contrast software
engineering with computer science. These two disciplines are closely
related, but they have some differences. It is important to gain this
understanding as you review the material in subunit 1.1.1.2. Also, spend
some time on the three commonly used methodologies in software
engineering (i.e., data-oriented, process-oriented and object-oriented).
You will find this central theme (i.e. the three methodologies) repeated
in software requirements and analysis as well as software design.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 20.5 hours.

    conversely, confusing).  
        
     A methodology is a body of practices within a discipline (e.g.
    software engineering). It can contain procedures, techniques, and
    processes. According to Conger, there are five classes of software
    engineering methodologies. For the purpose of this course, you will
    look at the more commonly used data-oriented, process-oriented, and
    object-oriented (OO) methodologies. This course places special
    emphasis on the OO methodology. The OO perspective is compliant with
    ACM/IEEE’s Software Engineering curriculum.
