**Unit 2: Software Development Life Cycle Models** <span id="2"></span> 
*Software development life cycle (SDLC) refers to the process of
software development. The International Organization for
Standardization’s ISO12207, the industry standard for software life
cycle processes, describes the development process as consisting of
requirements, design, code, and (three levels of) testing. There are
different approaches to break down the work when developing software
systems. Waterfall, v-shape, prototype, incremental, spiral, etc. are
examples of SDLC models. Conceptually, each model provides specific
guidance to the sequencing and repetition of life cycle activities to
deliver high-quality software systems. The various life cycle models
fall into two basic categories: sequential and iterative.*  
    
 *As you review the material in this unit, try to see the similarities
in these two categories of life cycle models from the ISO12207
development process perspective (i.e., requirements, design, code, and
testing). This will help you grasp the basic concepts of SDLC. This unit
connects strongly with* Unit 9: Project Management*. Choosing and
managing a software life cycle process is a central component of project
management.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   define the term *software development life cycle* *(SDLC);*
-   list the sequence of activities and deliverables in a sequential
    life cycle model;
-   list the sequence of activities and deliverables in an iterative
    life cycle model; and
-   compare and contrast the two categories of life cycle models.

     Instructions: Watch this 2 minute video. The video provides an
    entertaining viewpoint that justifies the need for a formal software
    development life cycle process.  
        
     Watching this web media, taking notes, and then taking time off to
    comprehend should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read the material (18 pages). Pay particular
    attention to the primary processes on pages 7–9. The ISO/IEC 12207
    is a common framework for the software life cycle. The framework
    prescribes work breakdown for software life cycle processes as
    consisting of acquisition, supply, development, operation, and
    maintenance.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and then taking time off to
    comprehend should take approximately 5 hours and 30 minutes.

**2.2 Sequential Life Cycle Model** <span id="2.2"></span>

    Engineering*](http://globaltext.terry.uga.edu/booklist?cat=Computing):
    “Chapter 1: Overview of Software Engineering” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the sections titled “Project Life Cycles” and
    “Sequential Project Life Cycle” in Chapter 1 on pages 23–28. The
    sequential life cycle model, also known as a *waterfall* approach,
    has a work breakdown structure where the stages of work are executed
    in sequence, and the output of each stage becomes input to the next
    stage.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and then taking time off to
    comprehend should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

    “Chapter 1: Overview of Software Engineering” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the section titled “Iterative Project Life
    Cycle” in Chapter 1 on pages 29–31. The sequential life cycle model
    has an inherent limitation that it does not recognize the iterative
    or nonlinear nature of certain types of application development.
    Under certain conditions, the iterative life cycle may be more
    appropriate. For example, if requirements are not fully known, it
    may be appropriate to jointly discover the requirements of an
    application by applying the iterative life cycle model.  
        
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and then taking time off to
    comprehend should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.
